I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of [IEOR](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I am very fortunate to work with [Garud Iyengar](http://www.columbia.edu/~gi10/), [Jay Sethuraman](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/faculty/jay-sethuraman), and [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/). 
I also worked with [Krzysztof Choromanski](https://research.google/people/KrzysztofChoromanski/) (Google Research).

I am broadly interested in the following topics:
- *Reliable* \[[1](#stability)\] and *efficient* \[[2](#HRF)\] machine learning models that are stable under exogenous distribution shifts
- Optimization algorithms that take feedback loops into account 
- Designing and understanding online marketplaces from an operational (revenue maximization) perspective
  
 
From 2019 to 2021, I spent two wonderful years at [Georgia Tech ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) as a graduate student studying statistics and mathematics while working with [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/), [Debankur Mukherjee](https://www.debankur-mukherjee.com/), and  [Michael Damron](https://sites.google.com/view/mdamron22021)  on different topics including queuing systems, random matrix theory, and percolation theory.
